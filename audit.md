#### Audit target

- Assets Security

Whether the entire protocol is vulnerable to any kind of attack, specifically reentrancy or flashloan.

- Access Controls:

Whether the administrative functions are properly designed and implemented.

- Rounding issue

Whether every rounding is properly handled, including the internal calculation and interaction with constituent tokens and underlying dToken system.

- Token Logic

Whether the calculation is correct when deposit/convert/destroy and interacting with the underlying dToken system.

- Interest Calculation

Whether the interest generated by the underlying dToken yielding markets is calculated correctly and ready to be distributed to USR contracts.

- Interest Swap

Whether it is reasonable to make the assumption that at this stage, the swap from underlying constituent tokens to USDx is strictly 1:1. Whether current implementation can be easily migrate to a swap model with price and slippage.

- Upgradeability

Whether the whole protocol can be properly upgraded.
